# Quick Coming Soon Page For WordPress

This [fork](https://github.com/marktimemedia/wordpress-quick-coming-soon) creates a Coming Soon page with redirects to prevent non-logged-in people from seeing a site in development. You can use any existing page template, style it however you like, etc. 
To turn it off, simply deactivate the plugin.

### Vague Description of How To Use
1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Plugin will automatically create a published page with Title and Slug "Coming Soon" (if it does not already exist), and some simple content, then and enable the necessary redirects. You can change the title, but do **not** change the slug, redirects are based on the url your-site-name/coming-soon
3. You can use any existing page templates or styles you already have to create the Coming Soon page!
4. Non-logged-in users will need to access the admin area via your-site-name/wp-login.php in order to log in, otherwise they will be redirected back to the Coming Soon
5. When plugin is deactivated, "Coming Soon" page will move to the trash. If plugin is reactivated, "Coming Soon" page will move back to published.
